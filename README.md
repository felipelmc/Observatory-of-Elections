# Observatory of Elections

This is my personal repository of the discipline Observatory of Elections, taught by Professor Jaqueline Porto Zulini (FGV CPDOC).

It contains all class notes I have written during the semester. For each class, there is a collection of the main excerpts from the text read for the class, 
class notes and my personal answer to a question developed by the Professor according to the topic of the class.

The repository also includes the material I prepared for a seminar I did for the other students. It was based on the Professor's reading 
recommendation, the article *Do lulismo ao antipetismo? Polarização, partidarismo e voto nas eleições presidenciais brasileiras*, 
published in 2018 by André Borges and Robert Vidigal in the journal *Opinião Pública*.

Finally, it contains my final project of the discipline, which consisted of an analysis of the data published by George Avelino (CEPESP FGV-SP) in the report
"Opinião Pública Brasileira e seu lugar no Barômetro das Américas" (2019). The work was developed from the perspective of rational choice theory.
